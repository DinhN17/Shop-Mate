# Shop-Mate

## Description

The challenge for this assignment was to create our first fullstack application using MERN stack from the ground up as a group. Ultimately what we ended up creating is a website where users can create various types of lists, for shopping, checking off tasks and anything and everything else. Users are also able to share and collaborate on lists together to work towards checking everything off. 

This way when another user intends to travel to a unique country or continent they will have an idea what unique snacks they have to try when they go to a supermarket in another country. Our motivation for creating this application was for users to easily access and gain knowledge of different snacks local to the country they are travelling too, this site allows them to view top rated snacks from a country, veiw and browse through different categories of snacks, making it easier for users experience various different foods in a new country. Throughout this project we applied the knowlege gained from the Adelaide University Web Development bootcamp. We utilised the handlebars.js templating engine to dynamically generate our web pages. We applied tailwind throughout our project to create a beautiful and user friendly experience. Additionally we inlcluded mySQL (with javascript) to create databases for the site and sequelize's ORM to create our relational database structure.
