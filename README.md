# Shop-Mate

## Description

The challenge for this assignment was to create our first full-stack application using the MERN stack from the ground up as a group. Ultimately, what we ended up creating is a website where users can create various types of lists for shopping, checking off tasks, and anything else they need to organize. Users are also able to share and collaborate on lists together to work towards completing tasks. This would be a great application for housemates, families, and project groups to stay organized and ahead of tasks. Our motivation for creating this application was to help users easily stay organized throughout projects and shopping lists, ensuring items don't get purchased twice.

Throughout this project, we applied the knowledge gained from the Adelaide University Web Development boot camp. We utilized the MERN stack, using Mongoose for our database, Express for our server, React for our front end, and Node for our backend. To create a beautiful and sleek user interface, we used Chakra UI, a React component library. Additionally, we implemented Stripe, a payment API, to add more functionality to our project.
