# Project Technology
Throughout this project, we applied the knowledge gained from the Adelaide University Web Development boot camp. We utilized the MERN stack, using Mongoose for our database, Apollo GraphQL, Express for our server, React for our front end, and Node for our backend. To create a beautiful and sleek user interface, we used Chakra UI, a React component library. Additionally, we implemented Stripe, a payment API, to add more functionality to our project.
